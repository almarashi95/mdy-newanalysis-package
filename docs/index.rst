Welcome to newanalysis_source's documentation!
==============================================

The python package "newanalysis" contains all our homebrew functions for MDAnalysis,
that formerly were embedded into the MDAnalysis package and are now available as a separate python module.
Be aware that the API syntax of MDAnalysis has changed compared to the old version we have used for a long time.
